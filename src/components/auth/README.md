# Authentication Components

This directory contains components related to user authentication:

- `Login.tsx` - Component for user login
- `Signup.tsx` - Component for user registration
- `ForgotPassword.tsx` - Component for password recovery
- `ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Component for route protection based on authentication status

These components handle user authentication flows and should be used in conjunction with the authentication context and services.
