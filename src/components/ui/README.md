# UI Components

This directory contains reusable UI components that can be used throughout the application:

- `LoadingSpinner.tsx` - Spinner component for loading states
- `Loader.tsx` - Full-page loader component
- `Clock.tsx` - Clock display component
- `FeedbackWidget.tsx` - User feedback collection widget

These components are designed to be reusable across different parts of the application and should maintain a consistent design language.
