# API Services

This directory is intended for API-specific service modules that handle external API integrations and data fetching:

Currently, this directory is prepared for future API integrations. As the application grows, specific API service modules can be added here to maintain a clean separation of concerns.

Examples of future services might include:
- Third-party API integrations
- REST API clients
- GraphQL clients
- WebSocket services
